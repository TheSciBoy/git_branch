# Git Branch

A simple command line tool that when called (I recommend aliasing it to "gb" for quick access) will show a menu that
allows you to choose the branch to switch to.

It is the same as calling "git branch XYZ" where XYZ is the selected branch. It will fail for the same reasons that
git branch does.

It does not take any command line parameters.
